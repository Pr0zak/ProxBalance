  - Configurable rollback window (default: 24 hours, range: 1-168 hours)
  - Enabled by default with toggle in Automated Migrations UI
  - Prevents oscillating migrations and improves cluster stability
  - Bypassed for maintenance mode evacuations
- **Max Migrations Per Run** - Rate limiting (default: 3)
- **Cluster Health Checks** - Verify quorum and node status
- **Cooldown Periods** - Time between migrations per guest
- **Tag Respecting** - Honor ignore/exclude tags
- **Validation Before Execution** - Pre-flight checks
- **Penalty-Based Scoring** - No hard disqualifications, flexible targeting

### Tag-Based Controls
Fine-grained control over automation:
- **Ignore Tag** - `ignore` - Exclude from all automated migrations
- **Anti-Affinity Rules** - `exclude_<group>` - Enforce workload separation
- **Whitelist Mode** - `auto-migrate-ok` - Opt-in for migrations only
- **Tags Bypassed for Maintenance** - Priority evacuation override

See [Automation Guide](AUTOMATION.md) for detailed configuration.

#### Distribution Balancing

Automatically balances small VMs/CTs across nodes to achieve even guest distribution.

**What It Does:**
While traditional balancing focuses on CPU, memory, and I/O performance metrics, Distribution Balancing addresses a different problem: **uneven guest counts across nodes**. A node with 19 small VMs may show low resource usage but still suffers from:
- Management overhead
- Slower VM operations (start/stop/backup)
- Uneven workload distribution
- Harder cluster management

**Key Features:**
- Counts running guests on each node
- Identifies nodes with imbalanced guest distribution
- Recommends migrating small VMs/CTs from overloaded to underloaded nodes
- Only migrates guests meeting size criteria (‚â§ 2 CPU cores, ‚â§ 4 GB memory)
- Works alongside performance-based recommendations
- Respects all safety checks and tag exclusions

**Configuration:**
```
Enable: Dashboard ‚Üí Automated Migrations ‚Üí Distribution Balancing
Default: Disabled

Settings:
- Guest Count Threshold: 2 (min difference to trigger balancing)
- Max CPU Cores: 2 (only migrate guests with ‚â§ 2 cores, 0 = no limit)
- Max Memory GB: 4 (only migrate guests with ‚â§ 4 GB, 0 = no limit)
```

**How It Works:**
1. **Detect Imbalance**: Counts running guests (e.g., pve4: 19, pve6: 4)
2. **Check Threshold**: If difference ‚â• 2, proceed with balancing
3. **Find Small Guests**: On overloaded node, find guests ‚â§ 2 cores and ‚â§ 4 GB
4. **Generate Recommendations**: Suggest migrating to underloaded nodes
5. **Flag Recommendations**: Marked with `"distribution_balancing": true`

**Example Scenario:**
```
Before:
pve4: 19 small VMs (sonarr, prowlarr, DNS, monitoring, etc.)
pve6: 4 large VMs (databases, app servers)

Distribution Balancing Action:
- Finds eligible small VMs on pve4 (‚â§ 2 cores, ‚â§ 4 GB)
- Recommends migrating 5-7 small VMs: pve4 ‚Üí pve6
- Confidence score: 60 (moderate)
- Score improvement: 10 points

After:
pve4: 12-14 VMs (more manageable)
pve6: 9-11 VMs (better distributed)
Result: More even distribution, easier management
```

**Ideal For:**
- Clusters with many small utility VMs (DNS, monitoring, proxies, etc.)
- Nodes with significantly different guest counts
- Situations where performance metrics don't show the imbalance
- Improving cluster management simplicity

**Integration:**
- ‚úì Works alongside performance-based recommendations
- ‚úì Respects tag exclusions (`pb-ignore`, `pb-exclude-group`)
- ‚úì Checks storage compatibility
- ‚úì Subject to confidence score threshold (60)
- ‚úì Subject to minimum score improvement threshold
- ‚úì Subject to rollback detection
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Bypassed for maintenance mode evacuations (priority override)

**Tuning Tips:**
- **Too many migrations**: Increase guest_count_threshold to 3-4
- **Large VMs being migrated**: Decrease max_cpu_cores/max_memory_gb to 1/2
- **Not enough balancing**: Decrease guest_count_threshold to 1
- **Target specific VM sizes**: Adjust max_cpu_cores/max_memory_gb to match

See [Automation Guide - Distribution Balancing](AUTOMATION.md#distribution-balancing) for complete documentation.

## üè∑Ô∏è Advanced Features

### Anti-Affinity Rules
Tag-based system to enforce workload separation:

**Use Cases:**
- Keep database replicas on separate nodes
- Separate firewalls from services they protect
- Distribute redundant services
- Prevent single points of failure

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Both VMs get the same exclude tag
pvesh set /nodes/pve1/qemu/101/config --tags "exclude_database"
pvesh set /nodes/pve2/qemu/102/config --tags "exclude_database"
# ProxBalance will flag if they end up on the same node
```
