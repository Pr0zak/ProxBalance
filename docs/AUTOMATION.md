---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Enable Automated Migrations

1. Navigate to **Dashboard** ‚Üí **Automated Migrations** section
2. Click **Configure** button
3. Toggle **Enable Automated Migrations**
4. Configure your preferred settings (or use a preset)
5. Click **Save Configuration**

### 2. Choose a Schedule Preset

ProxBalance includes three pre-configured schedules:

**Conservative** (Recommended for Production)
- Runs every 30 minutes
- Only during night hours (10 PM - 6 AM)
- Requires 85% confidence score
- Maximum 2 migrations per run
- 120-minute cooldown between migrations

**Balanced** (Good for Most Environments)
- Runs every 15 minutes
- Daytime and nighttime windows
- Requires 75% confidence score
- Maximum 3 migrations per run
- 60-minute cooldown

**Aggressive** (Development/Testing)
- Runs every 5 minutes
- 24/7 migration window
- Requires 65% confidence score
- Maximum 5 migrations per run
- 30-minute cooldown

### 3. Test with Dry Run Mode

Before enabling live migrations:

1. Enable **Dry Run Mode**
2. Monitor the **Activity Log** and **Migration History**
3. Verify migrations would happen as expected
4. Disable **Dry Run Mode** when ready

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Basic Settings

#### Check Interval
How often the automation system evaluates the cluster for migrations.

```
Default: 5 minutes
Range: 1-60 minutes
```

**Recommendation**: Start with 15-30 minutes and adjust based on cluster dynamics.

#### Dry Run Mode
When enabled, automation evaluates and logs decisions but doesn't execute migrations.

```
Use Cases:
- Testing new configurations
- Monitoring automation behavior
- Validating time windows
```

---

### Schedule Presets

#### Using Presets

1. Click **Load Preset** dropdown
2. Select **Conservative**, **Balanced**, or **Aggressive**
3. Review auto-populated settings
4. Customize if needed
5. Click **Save Configuration**

#### Customizing Presets

All preset values are editable after loading:
- Modify check intervals
- Adjust confidence thresholds
- Change migration limits
- Update time windows

---

### Time Windows

Control **when** migrations can occur using Migration Windows and Blackout Windows.

**Timezone Support**: All time windows support configurable timezone selection (e.g., America/Chicago, UTC, Europe/London). The system displays the current time in your selected timezone and evaluates windows accordingly.

#### Migration Windows

Define specific times when migrations ARE allowed.

**Example: Business Hours Only**
```
Window: "Business Hours"
Days: Monday-Friday
Time: 09:00 - 17:00
Type: Migration
```

**Example: Weekend Maintenance**
```
Window: "Weekend Maintenance"
Days: Saturday, Sunday
Time: 00:00 - 23:59
Type: Migration
```

#### Blackout Windows

Define specific times when migrations are BLOCKED.

**Example: Backup Windows**
```
Window: "Nightly Backups"
Days: All Days
Time: 02:00 - 04:00
Type: Blackout
```

**Example: Business Critical Hours**
```
Window: "Peak Business"
Days: Monday-Friday
Time: 08:00 - 18:00
Type: Blackout
```

#### Visual Timeline

The unified Time Windows interface includes a 7-day visual timeline showing:
- **Green bars**: Migration windows (migrations allowed)
- **Red bars**: Blackout windows (migrations blocked)
- **Hour markers**: Time labels at 6-hour intervals
- **Click-to-edit**: Click any window bar to edit it

#### Quick Presets

When creating time windows, use quick preset buttons:
- **All Day**: 00:00 - 23:59
- **Business Hours**: 09:00 - 17:00
- **Night**: 22:00 - 06:00

#### Window Priority

When windows overlap:
1. **Blackout Windows always take priority** over Migration Windows
2. If no windows are defined, migrations are allowed 24/7
3. If only Migration Windows exist, migrations are ONLY allowed during those windows

---

### Safety Checks

#### Required Safety Checks

**Prevent Migrations During Cluster Issues**
- ‚úì Cluster quorum must be healthy
- ‚úì Target node must be online and responsive
- ‚úì Source node must not be in maintenance mode (unless evacuation)
- ‚úì VM/CT must be running and not locked

#### Confidence Score Threshold

Minimum AI confidence score required to execute a migration.

```
Conservative: 85%
Balanced: 75%
Aggressive: 65%
Custom: 1-100%
```

Higher scores = more conservative migrations with stronger justification.

#### Cooldown Period

Prevents the same VM from being migrated too frequently.

```
Conservative: 120 minutes
Balanced: 60 minutes
Aggressive: 30 minutes
Custom: 1-1440 minutes
```

#### Maximum Migrations Per Run

Limits how many VMs can be migrated in a single automation cycle.

```
Conservative: 2 migrations
Balanced: 3 migrations
Aggressive: 5 migrations
Custom: 1-10 migrations
```

**Why limit?**
- Prevents cluster thrashing
- Reduces network congestion
- Allows monitoring between batches

#### Pause After Failure

Automatically disables automation if any migration fails.

```
‚úì Enabled (Recommended)
- Requires manual review before resuming
- Prevents cascading failures
- Protects cluster stability

‚úó Disabled
- Continues automation despite failures
- Use only in dev/test environments
```

---

### Advanced Rules

#### Guest Tags

Control which VMs can be automatically migrated using tags.

**Ignore Tag**
```
Tag: pb-ignore
Effect: VM is never migrated by automation
Use: Critical VMs, databases, specific workloads
```

**Exclude Groups**
```
Tag: pb-exclude-group:production
Effect: VMs in same group stay on different nodes
Use: HA configurations, redundancy requirements
```

See [Guest Tag Management](../README.md#tagging-guests) for details.

#### Minimum Score Improvement Threshold

Controls the minimum score improvement (in points) required for a migration to be recommended.

**Location**: Configuration ‚Üí Penalty Scoring ‚Üí Minimum Score Improvement

```
Default: 15 points
Range: 1-100 points
```

**What it does**:
- Filters out migrations that provide only marginal benefit
- Higher values = more conservative (fewer migrations)
- Lower values = more aggressive (more migrations)

**Recommended Values**:
```
Conservative (20-30): Only migrate when there's significant benefit
Balanced (10-15): Default setting, good balance between optimization and stability
Aggressive (5-10): More sensitive to small imbalances
Very Aggressive (1-5): Consider even minor improvements (testing only)
```

**Impact on Automation**:
- Affects which recommendations appear in the automation queue
- Works alongside confidence score threshold
- Both thresholds must be met for a migration to execute

**Example**:
```
If min_score_improvement = 15:
- VM with 14-point improvement: Skipped (below threshold)
- VM with 18-point improvement: Considered for migration
- VM with 25-point improvement: Higher priority candidate
```

**When to Adjust**:
- **Too many migrations**: Increase to 20-30
- **Cluster imbalanced**: Decrease to 5-10
- **Small VMs not migrating**: Decrease to 5-10 (or use Distribution Balancing)
- **Production stability focus**: Keep at 15-20

---

#### Rollback Detection

Prevents migration loops by detecting when a VM would be migrated back to a node it was recently migrated from.

**Location**: Configuration ‚Üí Automated Migrations ‚Üí Rollback Detection

```
Default: Enabled
Rollback Window: 24 hours
Range: 1-168 hours
```

**What it does**:
- Checks migration history before executing a migration
- Detects if VM was recently migrated FROM the target node TO the source node
- Prevents migration loops and unnecessary back-and-forth moves
- Improves cluster stability

**How it works**:
```
Example scenario:
1. VM 100 migrated from pve3 ‚Üí pve5 (1 hour ago)
2. Automation suggests migrating VM 100 from pve5 ‚Üí pve3
3. Rollback detection: BLOCKS migration (within 24-hour window)
4. VM stays on pve5, preventing migration loop
```

**Configuration**:
```json
{
  "automated_migrations": {
    "rules": {
      "rollback_detection_enabled": true,
      "rollback_window_hours": 24
    }
  }
}
```

**When to Enable**:
- **Always recommended** for production environments
- Prevents oscillating migrations between nodes
- Protects against unstable cluster conditions
- Reduces unnecessary migration overhead

**When to Disable**:
- Testing migration behavior
- Deliberately moving VMs back to original nodes
- Troubleshooting cluster issues
- **Not recommended** for production

**Rollback Window Tuning**:
```
Short window (1-12 hours):
- Faster recovery from intentional migrations
- May not catch all oscillation patterns
- Use in stable, well-tuned clusters

Default window (24 hours):
- Good balance for most environments
- Catches daily oscillation patterns
- Recommended for production

Long window (48-168 hours):
- Very conservative approach
- Catches weekly oscillation patterns
- Use for critical production workloads
```

**Bypassed for**:
- Maintenance mode evacuations (priority override)
- Emergency node evacuations

---

#### Distribution Balancing

Automatically balances small VMs/CTs across nodes to distribute guest counts evenly.

**Location**: Configuration ‚Üí Automated Migrations ‚Üí Distribution Balancing

```
Default: Disabled
Guest Count Threshold: 2
Max CPU Cores: 2 (0 = no limit)
Max Memory GB: 4 (0 = no limit)
```

**What it does**:
- Identifies nodes with uneven guest distribution
- Recommends migrating small VMs/CTs from overloaded to underloaded nodes
- Complements performance-based recommendations
- Only migrates guests meeting size criteria

**How it works**:
```
Example scenario:
1. pve4 has 19 running guests, pve6 has 4 running guests (diff = 15)
2. Guest count difference >= threshold (2): ELIGIBLE for distribution balancing
3. Find small guests on pve4 (‚â§ 2 CPU cores, ‚â§ 4 GB memory)
4. Generate recommendations to migrate eligible guests: pve4 ‚Üí pve6
5. Recommendations have moderate confidence (60) and "distribution_balancing" flag
```

**Configuration**:
```json
{
  "distribution_balancing": {
    "enabled": false,
    "guest_count_threshold": 2,
    "max_cpu_cores": 2,
    "max_memory_gb": 4
  }
}
```

**Settings**:

**Guest Count Threshold** (Range: 1-10)
- Minimum difference in guest counts to trigger balancing
- Higher values = less sensitive (only balance major imbalances)
- Lower values = more sensitive (balance minor imbalances)
- Example: threshold=2 means pve4(10 guests) vs pve6(7 guests) won't trigger

**Max CPU Cores** (Range: 0-32, 0 = no limit)
- Only migrate guests with ‚â§ this many CPU cores
- Prevents migrating large, resource-intensive VMs
- Default: 2 cores (targets small utility VMs)
- Example: max_cpu_cores=2 means 4-core VMs stay put
- Set to 0 to disable CPU filtering

**Max Memory GB** (Range: 0-256, 0 = no limit)
- Only migrate guests with ‚â§ this amount of memory
- Prevents migrating memory-intensive workloads
- Default: 4 GB (targets small utility VMs)
- Example: max_memory_gb=4 means 8GB VMs stay put
- Set to 0 to disable memory filtering

**Recommended Values**:
```
Conservative (threshold=3, cpu=1, mem=2):
- Only balance significant imbalances
- Only migrate very small guests (DNS, proxies)
- Minimal distribution activity

Balanced (threshold=2, cpu=2, mem=4):
- Default settings
- Targets small utility VMs (monitoring, services)
- Good balance between distribution and stability
- Suitable for most clusters

Aggressive (threshold=1, cpu=4, mem=8):
- Balance even minor imbalances
- Migrate small to medium guests
- More distribution activity
```

**When to Enable**:
- Clusters with uneven guest distribution
- Nodes with significantly different guest counts
- Small utility VMs (DNS, monitoring, etc.)
- When performance-based recommendations don't address imbalance

**When to Disable**:
- Clusters already evenly distributed
- All guests are large (>16GB, >4 cores)
- Specific placement requirements
- Testing performance-based migrations only

**Integration with Other Features**:
- **Works alongside** performance-based recommendations
- **Respects** tag-based exclusions (ignore, affinity)
- **Respects** storage compatibility checks
- **Bypassed for** maintenance mode evacuations
- **Subject to** confidence score threshold (60)
- **Subject to** minimum score improvement threshold
- **Subject to** rollback detection

**Recommendations**:
```
- Flag: "distribution_balancing": true
- Confidence Score: 60 (moderate)
- Score Improvement: 10 points
- Reason: "Distribution balancing: pve4 (19 guests) ‚Üí pve6 (4 guests)"
```

**Impact**:
- Helps achieve even guest distribution
- Reduces node overload from guest count alone
- Improves cluster resource utilization
- May not improve performance metrics directly

**Tuning Tips**:
- **Too many distribution migrations**: Increase guest_count_threshold to 3-4
- **Large VMs being migrated**: Decrease max_cpu_cores/max_memory_gb
- **Not enough balancing**: Decrease guest_count_threshold to 1
- **Want to balance specific guests**: Adjust max_cpu_cores/max_memory_gb to match

---

#### Maintenance Mode Evacuation

When a node is placed in maintenance mode:
- VMs are automatically evacuated to other nodes
- **Bypasses** most automation filters (tags, affinity)
- **Still requires** minimum confidence score
- **Respects** time windows and blackout periods

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Migrations Not Happening

**Check 1: Automation Enabled?**
```
Dashboard ‚Üí Automated Migrations ‚Üí Status should show "Active"
```

**Check 2: Dry Run Mode?**
```
Look for yellow "DRY RUN MODE" indicator
If enabled, migrations are simulated only
```

**Check 3: Time Windows**
```
Verify current time is within Migration Window
Check for overlapping Blackout Windows
Review visual timeline
```

**Check 4: Activity Log**
```
Check "Activity Log (Last Check)" section
Shows why VMs are being skipped:
- Cooldown period
- Low confidence score
- Tag restrictions
- Affinity violations
```

**Check 5: Recommendations Available?**
```
Dashboard ‚Üí Recommendations section
If empty, automation has nothing to execute
```

### Too Many Migrations

**Solution 1: Increase Cooldown**
```
Configuration ‚Üí Rules ‚Üí Cooldown Period
Increase to 120+ minutes
```

**Solution 2: Increase Confidence Threshold**
```
Configuration ‚Üí Rules ‚Üí Min Confidence Score
Raise to 85%+ for more selective migrations
```

**Solution 3: Reduce Max Migrations Per Run**
```
Configuration ‚Üí Rules ‚Üí Max Migrations Per Run
Lower to 1-2 migrations
```

**Solution 4: Narrow Migration Windows**
```
Configuration ‚Üí Time Windows
Restrict to specific hours (e.g., night only)
```

### Failed Migrations

**Automatic Pause**
```
If "Pause After Failure" is enabled:
- Automation automatically disables
- Review failure reason
- Fix underlying issue
- Re-enable automation
```

**Common Causes**:
- Insufficient resources on target node
- Storage not available on target
- Network connectivity issues
- VM locked during backup

**Resolution**:
1. Check Recent Auto-Migrations for error details
2. Verify target node health
3. Check storage replication
4. Review VM state
5. Test manual migration first
6. Re-enable automation when ready

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Start Conservative

Begin with Conservative preset:
- Fewer migrations
- Higher confidence threshold
- Limited time windows
- Monitor for 1-2 weeks

### 2. Enable Dry Run First

Always test configuration changes:
```
1. Enable Dry Run Mode
2. Monitor Activity Log
3. Verify expected behavior
4. Disable Dry Run
```

### 3. Use Time Windows

Protect critical business hours:
```
Migrations: Nights and weekends
Blackouts: Business hours, backup windows
```

### 4. Monitor Regularly

Check dashboard weekly:
- Success rates
- Migration patterns
- Skip reasons
- Rollback warnings

### 5. Tune Based on Cluster

Adjust settings based on your workload:
- **Stable clusters**: More aggressive
- **Dynamic workloads**: More conservative
- **Critical production**: Minimal automation

### 6. Tag Critical VMs

Use `pb-ignore` tag for:
- Database servers
- Domain controllers
- Storage nodes
- Any VM that requires manual migration planning

### 7. Respect Cooldowns

Don't set cooldown too low:
- Minimum recommended: 60 minutes
- Prevents migration thrashing
- Allows cluster to stabilize

### 8. Review Rollback Warnings

Orange rollback warnings indicate:
- Possible target node issues
- Incorrect migration decisions
- Need to investigate further

### 9. Export History Regularly

Monthly CSV exports for:
- Trend analysis
- Capacity planning
- Audit trails
- Performance reporting

### 10. Enable Pause After Failure

Always enable in production:
- Prevents cascading failures
- Requires manual review
- Protects cluster stability
