## Migration Guide

### From Manual Installation to Automated Installer

If you previously installed manually and want to use the automated installer:

1. Backup your configuration:
   ```bash
   pct exec <container-id> -- cp /opt/proxmox-balance-manager/config.json ~/config.backup.json
   ```

2. Note your SSH keys and settings

3. Destroy old container:
   ```bash
   pct stop <container-id>
   pct destroy <container-id>
   ```

4. Run new installer:
   ```bash
   bash -c "$(wget -qLO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pr0zak/ProxBalance/main/install.sh)"
   ```

5. Restore custom settings if needed
