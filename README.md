## üÜï Recent Updates

### UI Update Enhancement
The UI-triggered update now includes **automatic frontend optimization** with clear progress indicators and full build process integration. One-time Node.js installation and Babel compilation ensure 93% faster page loads for all users.

### Intelligent Penalty-Based Scoring System
ProxBalance features a sophisticated **penalty-based scoring algorithm** with **Suitability Ratings (0-100%)** for intuitive migration decisions. The system evaluates CPU, memory, IOWait, load distribution, storage compatibility, and anti-affinity rules to find optimal migration targets without hard disqualifications.

**Key benefits:**
- 100% = Perfect target, 0% = Poor target (easy to understand)
- IOWait penalties prioritize I/O performance for better VM responsiveness
- Flexible scoring allows evacuating overloaded nodes without restrictions
- Seamlessly integrates with automated migrations

‚û°Ô∏è **[Read the complete Scoring Algorithm Guide](docs/SCORING_ALGORITHM.md)** for detailed explanation, examples, and configuration options.

### Migration & Monitoring Enhancements
- **Real-Time Transfer Speed** - Live MB/s transfer rates during migrations
- **Multi-Disk Progress Tracking** - Accurate progress for VMs with multiple disks
- **Migration History Pagination** - Configurable page size (5-100 entries) with 7-day accurate timeline

### Automation Improvements
- **Automated Recommendations** - Dynamic cluster-aware recommendation generation via systemd timer
- **Infinite Polling with Resource Validation** - Enhanced monitoring prevents conflicts and validates resources
- **Enhanced Concurrency** - Improved tracking of concurrent automated migrations

### UI/UX & Performance
- **Lightning-Fast Page Load** - Pre-compiled JSX architecture reduces LCP from 6.5s to 0.48s (93% faster)
- **Optimized Frontend Build** - Babel CLI pre-compilation eliminates browser transpilation overhead
- **Local React Libraries** - Self-hosted React/React-DOM eliminates CDN latency
- **Enhanced Status Displays** - Better real-time feedback for migrations and automation
- **Optimized Section Layout** - Improved workflow with better UI organization
- **VM Clumping Prevention** - Enhanced load distribution logic
- **Migration Conflict Prevention** - Better detection and prevention of concurrent operations

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation (5 minutes)

Run this command on your Proxmox host:

```bash
bash -c "$(wget -qLO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pr0zak/ProxBalance/main/install.sh)"
```

The installer will:
1. Auto-detect your cluster nodes
2. Create an unprivileged LXC container
3. Install and configure ProxBalance
4. Create API tokens with proper permissions
5. Start all services

### Access

Once installed, open `http://<container-ip>` in your browser.
